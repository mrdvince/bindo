# Bindo

Basically trying to figure out binding rust and c (how it works/how to do it), becuase why not.

Run `cargo buld` to generate the bindings.

This is from the rust bindgen tut, so you need bzip2 installed on you machine.

To see some test run:

```
cargo test --package bindo --bin bindo -- tests --show-output
```
