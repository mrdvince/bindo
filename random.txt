If you can keep your cool when everyone else is losing their shit and trying to drag you down, then you've got something special. If you can trust yourself when everyone else is doubting you, and still give them the benefit of the doubt, then you're a real badass.

If you can wait and stay patient even when it feels like everything is going wrong, and not be afraid to call out bullshit when you see it, then you're on the right path. If you can keep your head high and not let success or failure get to your head, then you're a true champion.

If you can listen to others and take their feedback without losing your own sense of self, and still treat them with respect even if they don't agree with you, then you're the real deal. If you can lose everything and still have the balls to start over, and never let anyone see you sweat, then you're a fucking hero.

If you can push yourself to the brink of exhaustion and still keep going, and hold on even when it seems like there's nothing left, then you're an inspiration. If you can stand up for what you believe in and still keep your integrity intact, even when others try to bring you down, then you're a king among men.

And if you can make every second count, and squeeze every drop of life out of this mother fucking planet, then you've got the world by the balls, my friend. So go out there and take what's yours, because you're a fucking boss, and nothing can stop you.
